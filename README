A friend of mine told me of their woes following the sudden disappearance of
their favourite YouTube channel that'd offer videos of various duration to serve
as a *timer*.

How could *that* be the timer most suitable to their need?  Well, they wanted:

Something that loops, something that's easily set up without to type all over
the place, and most primarily: the option to start an <X>-minute timer already
<Y>% through its <Z>th loop.  And you know what?  With those requirements, I
could indeed not quite find an adequate drop-in replacement—so I made one.

It's a timer.

It serves a particular timer-niche that not all timers do, but it also may be
used as any ol' regular timer would.  It's a fairly usable one at that, though
it doesn't adapt too well to mobile just yet: none of its users cared at all for
that so far.

Philosophy ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the way of features, the main recurring theme is that you can't
    "break" that app, whatever you do, it's fine with it.  The rest of the
    configuration will adjust to make sense of the most recent, possibly
    clashing, change you're introducing, regardless of whether it's running,
    paused, not started or ended.

    A little "beep" sound occurs at the end of each loop, unless you've
    toggled that off through the button that displays a music note.  That
    beep is as possibly non-obnoxious a beep as could be conceived, yet
    still savvily chosen to be heard even while in the middle of some pretty
    intense gaming session and listening to some music.  That's a lot for an
    8kb ogg file, heh?

Features -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Its only feature that you may not come to figure out on your own by
    clicking frantically everywhere and trying hard to break it is that you
    may scroll up and down over any number to manipulate it.

    You can enable or disable looping.  You can have any number of loops,
    up to infinitely many.  You can choose, at any moment to *be* at any
    iteration ("loop") that you wish.  If you forcibly move past the maximum
    number of loops, that number will increase.  If you decrease that
    maximum number below that of your current iteration, no worries, the
    obvious happens.

    The same way, you can choose, at any time, to be at any progress of your
    current loop.

    - You may pause or resume.
    - You may choose to display the time remaining or the time elapsed.
    - You may drag and drop the linear slider, type in the hours, minutes
      and seconds, or simply scroll up or down over any of numeric "inputs".
    - Every numeric valid is one such input.
    - To loop indefinitely, use button labelled with a looping icon next to
      the loop counter.

What else ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I could have some configuration saving/loading mechanism, some
    light/dark themes, or anything else you want: just ask me, I'm having
    fun with this.
